# valid-xltx-with-theme

The `out/Book.xltx` file was created using the OpenXML SDK:

```bash
create xl-template
```
The custom JBC theme and appropriate code was added manually, the updated file is under the `in` folder.

When you download and open this file in Excel 2016, the theme appears to be applied, however it is not actively selected -- even though the colors and fonts are applied. 

I tested by creating a new chart and the colors were properly applied to the chart.
